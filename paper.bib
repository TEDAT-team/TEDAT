This convergence time reflects the time required by a network to react to the failure of a link or a router. To characterise the convergence process, we first use detailed measurements to determine the time required to perform the various operations of a link state protocol on currently deployed routers. We then build a simulation model based on those measurements and use it to study the convergence time in large networks. Our measurements and simulations indicate that sub-second link-state IGP convergence can be easily met on an ISP network without any compromise on stability.}, journal = {SIGCOMM Comput. Commun.

Path splicing allows traffic to switch trees at any hop en route to the destination. End systems can change the path on which traffic is forwarded by changing a small number of additional bits in the packet header. We evaluate path splicing for intradomain routing using slices generated from perturbed link weights and find that splicing achieves reliability that approaches the best possible using a small number of slices, for only a small increase in latency and no adverse effects on traffic in the network. In the case of interdomain routing, where splicing derives multiple trees from edges in alternate backup routes, path splicing achieves near-optimal reliability and can provide significant benefits even when only a fraction of ASes deploy it. We also describe several other applications of path splicing, as well as various possible deployment paths.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2008 Conference on Data Communication}, pages = {27-38}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {path diversity, multi-path routing, path splicing}, location = {Seattle, WA, USA}, series = {SIGCOMM '08} }

In this paper, we show that existing congestion-free mechanisms, notably FFC, achieve performance far short of the network's intrinsic capability. We propose PCF, a set of novel congestion-free mechanisms to bridge this gap. PCF achieves these goals by better modeling network structure, and by carefully enhancing the flexibility of network response while ensuring that the performance under failures can be tractably modeled. All of PCF's schemes involve relatively light-weight operations on failures, and many of them can be realized using a local proportional routing scheme similar to FFC. We show PCF's effectiveness through formal theoretical results, and empirical experiments over 21 Internet topologies. PCF's schemes provably out-perform FFC, and in practice, can sustain higher throughput than FFC by a factor of 1.11X to 1.5X on average across the topologies, while providing a benefit of 2.6X in some cases.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication on the Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication}, pages = {139-153}, numpages = {15}, keywords = {network resilience, network optimization}, location = {Virtual Event, USA}, series = {SIGCOMM '20} }
